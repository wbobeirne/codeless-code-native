After several days spent shovelling snow,
the nuns Yíwen and Hwídah succumbed to the bitter cold
and were given leave to recuperate in the hot baths.  A blindfolded
young monk was sent there to find them.

“Master Yishi-Shing says that he has swum deep through
your ocean of log files and discovered a pearl,” said the
monk.  He waved a printout in the general direction of the
splashing until it was taken from his hand.

“These are stack traces for NullPointerExceptions,” sniffled
Yíwen.  “All were thrown during our long-running data processing
job.”

“Most likely the problem is bad data,” said Hwídah, her voice
muffled by the hot towel she had draped over her face to clear
her sinuses.

“Many pardons,” said Yíwen to the monk.  “But I cannot tell
what records were being processed.  Where are the info messages
that we log to provide context?”

“They are no longer output,” said the monk. “The flood of
spurious warnings and errors was causing the log
files to grow too quickly.  Something had to be done
to prevent them from filling up the disk.  So Yishi-Shing
decreed that debug and info messages, being non-critical,
should be suppressed.”

Yíwen sighed, thrust the printout into the arms of the
sightless monk, and slipped back into the bathwater.
“Yishi-Shing rakes the seabed for pearls only.  He throws
out every oyster unopened because their shells are ugly
and his raft is small.”

“He has forgotten the very purpose of fishermen,” said
Hwídah from under her towel.  ‘Now, bedecked in orphan
pearls, we will starve for want of oyster-meat.”
