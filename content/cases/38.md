A novice asked Java master Banzen, “What is the most perfect
programming language?”

The master answered, “The one which accomplishes the
desired task with the least effort expended by the user.”

The novice asked, “Is there a language which exceeds all
others in this regard?”

The master answered, “Build me a garden of ten thousand
stones!”

## Qi’s commentary

Management, too, has its programming languages,
although what they produce is frequently defective.

## Qi’s poem

Whether or not the garden was built, 
Banzen got his desire. 
The novice came no more for counsel—
Words conceal intent.
