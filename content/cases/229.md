A certain monk heard that master Suku knew the secret of
designing code for maximum reusability.  But whenever the
monk begged the master to share her wisdom, Suku only walked
away.  Exasperated, the monk asked one of Suku’s three
apprentices for help.

“To learn the master’s great secret, you must approach her
correctly,” explained the apprentice.  “Come; I shall assist
you.”

The apprentice gave the monk special ceremonial robes, which
were several sizes too large and had to be wound twice
around his arms and legs.  To keep the robes from unraveling
the apprentice tied a long sash tightly around the monk’s
body from wrists to ankles.  When the monk protested that
walking was now impossible, the apprentice only nodded,
saying that the monk was meant to approach Suku on his belly,
with his head low and his feet high.

Angrily the monk writhed slowly down the corridor on his
stomach, cursing Suku and wondering whether any information could
possibly be worth such ridiculous effort.

At this thought, the monk was suddenly enlightened.

## Qi’s commentary

Some masters answer a question with a single gesture; Suku
answered without even being asked.  The master has a most
efficient API indeed, for she returns a usable value even
when her function is not called.

## Qi’s poem

The general wanted a mount that could cross the Empire. 
The groom delivered only a plush saddle. 
Many fine horses stumble on stony roads—
Sometimes even a general should think with his posterior.
