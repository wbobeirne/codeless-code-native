The Emperor was angered by the defects in the new order
processing system he had commissioned, and so dispatched a
messenger to the temple, to investigate the monks there.

“His Excellency sent you his most trusted Business Analysts
to ensure that all features would work as intended,” scowled
the messenger.  “Did you not comprehend any of their numerous
PowerPoint presentations?”

“We attended each one,” said the Java master.  “And all that
was heard, was understood.”

The master set a small bowl of rice before the messenger,
who finished it promptly.  The messenger wiped his mouth
upon his sleeve and continued:

“These same Analysts provided you with ten thousand pages of
requirements documents, meticulously illustrated down to the
last Use Case.  Did you not trouble yourselves to examine them?”

“We sifted through each page,” said the Java master.  “And
all that was read, was understood.”  The master set a
steaming cup of tea before the messenger, who downed it in
one gulp.

The messenger then fell forward onto the table, dead.

The master asked of his students: “Did the messenger not
know that it is our custom to surround ourselves with poisoned
food and drink, that we may better resist the urges of the
flesh?”

Said the wisest monk: “All that was observed by the messenger,
was understood.”
