After master Banzen had delivered a presentation on
design practices, a monk lingered at the great doorway
instead of going outside with his fellows.  The monk then
asked Banzen: “Which provides superior guidance: the
Pattern, or the Anti-Pattern?”

Banzen glanced left and right, as though ascertaining whether
anyone else was in earshot.  He then raised his index finger
and crooked it twice.  The young monk recognized this gesture and
approached the master’s podium.

Banzen’s eyes again darted around, and again he raised his
index finger and crooked it twice.  The monk nodded and
climbed the steps of the podium to stand directly before
the master.

Banzen tilted his head forward and again crooked his finger twice.
The monk leaned in close to listen.

The master smacked the monk hard in the ear, sending him
reeling down the steps in pain.  Banzen gathered his
papers, descended the podium, and calmly walked past the
crumpled form of the monk.  When the master reached the
great doorway he turned back and shouted, “Monk!”

The monk looked up.  Banzen crooked his finger twice.

This time, the monk did not move closer.

Banzen nodded with satisfaction and went out.  In that
instant the monk was enlightened.
