On Monday a novice asked master Banzen: What is the
greatest aspiration?

Banzen replied: to know all that can be known, so that
one’s code may never be improved upon.

On Tuesday another novice asked Banzen: What is the greatest
aspiration?

Banzen replied: to be surrounded always by
colleagues whose knowledge is more extensive,
so that one may be in a continual state of improvement.

On Wednesday a third novice observed that the answers
were mutually exclusive; indeed, they were almost exact opposites.

Banzen replied: that is so.

The novice, thinking he had the upper hand, then asked Banzen
how one should set about attaining the greatest aspiration.

Irritated, Banzen replied: on Monday I was asked the greatest
positive number; on Tuesday, the number half its size.  I
answered each question in one breath.  But if I must show
you how to count to either, the moon will turn to sand
before we have barely begun.

The novice bowed in shame and left.

A gardener—who had been pruning the bonsai tree on Banzen’s
table—confessed that he did not understand how the
novice could be found in error, for the questions on Monday
and Tuesday were indeed identical.

Banzen replied: that bonsai needs water, as does the
oak outside my window.
