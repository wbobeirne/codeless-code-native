It is the duty of every monk to call upon master Kaimu at least once during their time at the temple.  When the
master opens his door the monk must bow and ask: “What is
the great joy of stateless services?”

Without fail master Kaimu will reply: “Ten thousand guests
fed by a single grain of rice.”

The monk must then ask: “And what is the great sorrow?”

Kaimu will reply: “The great sorrow of what?”
