Java master Kaimu left three novices
to debate the signature of a utility method that was needed.  An hour
later he found all three in his office, bruised and
quite dissheveled.

“Have you reached agreement?” asked Kaimu.

The first novice, sporting a torn robe and cut lip, said:
“We are even further from a peaceful conclusion than before.
Each of us still prefers his own solution to the two others.
We beg you to make the best choice on our behalf.”

“Very well,” sighed Kaimu. “Among the three options offered,
one was bold enough to reject our tradition of strong typing
and declare the method to take an Object, so as to satisfy
all potential users.  Which of you proposed this?”

The second novice proudly stepped forward.  With a swift kick to
the stomach, the master sent him tumbling out the door.

## Qi’s commentary

The method that takes Object will cheerfully accept LeftFoot.

## Qi’s poem

A perfect frog crouches on the table, 
surrounded by shards of jade. 
With each blow, the sculptor has two choices: 
for, against.
