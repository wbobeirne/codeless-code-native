Two monks approached master Suku to settle a dispute.

The first monk said, “I have proposed a truly elegant design, but this monk says it is too complex and cannot be maintained.”

The second monk said, “I have proposed a truly simple design, but this monk says it is too limited and will not be useful.”

Suku turned to her whiteboard and drew a large phi, thusly:

The first monk said, “I do not understand.”

The second monk said, “Nor do I.”

Suku replied, “You argue in booleans; in zeros and ones.  Come back when you have learned floating point.”

## Qi’s commentary

Kaimu holds court over novices and masters, but they send the real fools to Suku. Kaimu's null can un-ask a bad question, but Suku’s phi will undo two bad answers.

## Qi’s poem

Kaimu has his null.  Suku prefers her golden mean.  The first commands reconsideration— the second, compromise.
