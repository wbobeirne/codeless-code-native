To mark the solemn occasion of the two-hundredth case being entered into the annals of the Temple, I asked the nun Yíwen to prepare for me a long, informative, and heavily-footnoted treatise on the history of the Boolean data type.  To my dismay I received this bit of doggerel instead.  Many apologies to those of you who came here seeking edification.—Qi.

You might  not know  that long  ago

most words,  when new,  came two  by two:

>         you / me, 
        aye / nay, 
        he / she, 
        we / they,

>         girl / boy, 
        yang / yin, 
        grief / joy, 
        out / in.

This is,  you see,  our ten-  dency—

treat all  in sight  as black  or white:

>         yes / no, 
        old / new, 
        stop / go, 
        false / true,

>         live / dead, 
        here / gone, 
        tail / head, 
        off / on.

No place  halfway.  No shades  of gray.

Just hit  or miss.  Just that  or this:

>         strong / frail, 
        smile / frown, 
        pass / fail, 
        up / down, 

>         quick / slow, 
        luck / fate, 
        high / low, 
        love / hate.

But if  you dare  to look  with care—

to stare  foursquare



at each allegedly opposing pair, 



fully aware  you must distrust your every instinct, and forswear  that inborn, impulsive tendency  to impose binary simplicity—

then eventually  you may see

that almost nothing  is wholly one thing or another.

For words—like floats and ints and bools— are merely tools,

providing only crude approximation  for the facilitation of communication.

And any string of words, however nice,  at best is imprecise,

while at worst may be tragically misleading  (and that includes the sentence you’re currently reading).



So here’s  my rule:

don’t think  in bool.

Leave cer-  tainty  to cir-  cuitry

(unless  you trust  the world  is just ...

>         sane / mad, 
        short / long, 
        good / bad, 
        right / wrong, 

>         left / right, 
        all / none, 
        day / night, 
        oh / one).
