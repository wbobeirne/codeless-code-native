Walking the halls of his abbey late at night, master
Bawan came upon a monk in distress.  A morning deadline
was fast approaching, and after three all-nighters the exhausted
monk had dropped his only remaining coins into the soda machine without
first noticing the paper sign taped to it.  The sign read
OUT OF ORDER
in large red
capitals.

“Can you fix it?” asked the monk, who knew of Bawan’s skill
with primitive machines.

Bawan studied the machine for a moment, then crossed out the letters
of the sign and under them wrote DEFOOORRTU.
Immediately a soda can dropped into the chute.

Satisfied, Bawan continued on his way.
