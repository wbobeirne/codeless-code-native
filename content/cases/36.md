The Sparrow Clan was in disgrace and disarray.  Its head
monk had chosen an honorable death by seppuku, but fear of
further staff cuts had set the remaining monks at each
other’s throats.  A priest had been assigned stewardship of
the clan to restore order, but his efforts were in vain.

“The subtraction of one has led to the division of all,”
said the priest to the head abbot.  “We must correct the
remainder of the clan before they set a poor example for the
temple.”

“I see no need for discipline,” sighed the abbot, who
was known for his excessive leniency.  “It
will be simpler to disband the Sparrow Clan.  How many monks
remain?”

“Six,” replied the priest.

“Good.  Then send half to one clan of your choosing, and
half to another.”

The priest began to protest, but thinking better of it he
merely bowed stiffly and left.  That evening he summoned the
quarrelsome monks.  With a single whirl of his blade
he neatly bisected all six at the waist.

“Send the heads to the Laughing Monkey Clan, and the tails
to the Elephant’s Footprint,” he said to one of his novices.
“And bid them consider the price of dischord.”

The priest then reported to the abbot: “I have done
as you commanded, and indeed all arguments have ceased.”
