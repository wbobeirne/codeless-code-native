Java master Suku entered the chambers of the Spider Clan’s
head abbot; a monk in her charge entered also.  They bowed.

Suku said to the abbot: “Last week I was ordered to
completely re-implement the data visualization module, whose
long tentacles have wormed their way into every crevice of
our system.  I requested seven developers with various
specialities so that the overhaul could be accomplished in
one iteration.  Yet you have assigned me only this solitary
monk.”

The abbot replied: “We cannot spare seven developers all at
once.  Instead, this monk will be allowed to perform the
work in seven iterations.  In exchange for this leniency he
must keep the system stable, since there are many new features
we wish to roll out to our users during that time.”

Suku nodded to the monk, who opened his hand and blew a
gust of red powder straight into the abbot’s face.  The
abbot gasped in surprise, inhaling a lungful as he did so.
He promptly collapsed on his desk.

The abbot awoke in a dark stone pit with a single candle
burning by his side.  As his eyes adjusted to the gloom he
beheld a note affixed to the trap door above him:

>     A boulder seven times your weight 
    rests upon the door, and holds it closed. 
    Yet take comfort—
    you may lift it as slowly as you desire.
