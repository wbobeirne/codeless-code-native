A young monk asked master Kaimu, “Other than technical proficiency, what is one essential quality for a master to have at all times?”

Kaimu answered   “Kindness.”

The monk asked, “When Banzen corrected me with his staff, who was he being kind to? “

Kaimu answered  “Your future self.”

The monk asked, “When Suku denied me a leadership post, who was she being kind to?”

Kaimu answered, “Our temple and our customers.”

The monk said, “Last week, Bawan sent an applicant plummeting off the cliffside tower for falsifying his resume. There were no customers, no temple, and now no future self.  Who was Bawan being kind to?”

Kaimu answered,  “The world.”
