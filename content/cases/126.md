Like many her age, the young nun Satou had an irrepressible curiosity: the less she knew about a thing, the more she wanted to try it.  Thus she had elected to use multithreading to improve performance in her log processing utility, despite master Banzen's cautions.

Banzen reviewed her code, then invited the nun to discuss his findings during the morning tea break.
