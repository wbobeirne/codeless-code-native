A novice asked master Banzen: “What separates the monk from the master?”

Banzen replied: “Ten thousand mistakes!”

The novice, not understanding, sought to avoid all error.
An abbot observed and brought the novice to Banzen for
correction.

Banzen explained: “I have made ten thousand mistakes; Suku has made ten thousand mistakes; the patriarchs of Open Source
have each made ten thousand mistakes.”

Asked the novice: “What of the old monk who labors in the
cubicle next to mine?  Surely he has made ten thousand mistakes.”

Banzen shook his head sadly.  “Ten mistakes, a thousand times each.”
