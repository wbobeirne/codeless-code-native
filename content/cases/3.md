A young monk, new to the temple, not only declared all his
methods public but all his instance variables as well.  The
head abbot grew weary of rebuking the monk and asked the
Java master for advice.

The next day, the master summoned the monk to take lunch
with him in his private office.

The monk entered to find a sumptuous meal laid out upon the
conference table.  The master then bade the monk to lie upon
the floor.

The monk did as commanded, whereupon the master opened the
monk’s robes and drew a large knife.  He pressed the naked
point firmly into the monk’s chest until a ruby droplet
welled up around the blade.  The monk cried out in terror
and asked the master what his intention was.

“To slit open your belly,” explained the master, “so that I
may spoon the rice and pour the tea inside.  My schedule is
quite full, and I find this method of feeding guests to be
extremely efficient.”

Afterward the monk required no more correction.
