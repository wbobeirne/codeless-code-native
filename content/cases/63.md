The nun Zjing had acquired an aversion to heights.  A
young monk found her in her new quarters: a small hut
nestled at the lowest point of a valley seven hundred feet
below the Temple.

The monk sat down, for Zjing had taken to working while lying
on the floor.

“I have written a most elegant subsystem for our
image-rendering pipeline,” said the monk.  “It has increased
throughput dramatically, yet it is extremely fragile.  Every
change must be made with the utmost caution or chaos will
result.  For a solid year I have maintained the code,
trusting it to no one else.  Now my nerves are frayed.  I
must move on to other projects or risk the loss of my few
remaining wits.”

“I understand,” said Zjing, clutching the floor as she sat
upright to examine the code on the monk’s laptop.  “You
fear the inevitable day when your successor makes a careless
change and the system falls apart.”

“Yes—for I shall be blamed, and rightly so!” cried the
monk. “How can I best ensure that such a disaster will not
occur?  By extensive comments in the code?  By extensive
documentation outside the code?  By providing a hundred
unit tests that will fail if incorrect changes are made?  By
permeating the code with a hundred consistency checks—thus
increasing its complexity even more?  Or by remaining on
this project until my brains turn to jelly?”

“Wú,” said the nun.  She selected the directory that held the
subsystem’s source code, hit the delete button, and crawled
out the door.
