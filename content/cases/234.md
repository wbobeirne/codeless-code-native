The nun Hwídah has composed this uncharacteristically
somber sonnet for your contemplation:

>      I chanced upon an ancient cache of code:       
     a stack of printouts, tall as any man,         
     that in decaying boxes had been stowed.        
     Ten thousand crumbling pages long it ran.      
     Abandoned in the blackness to erode,           
     what steered a ship through blackness to the moon. 
     The language is unused in this late year.      
     The target hardware, likewise, lies in ruin.   
     Entombed within one lone procedure’s scope,    
     a line of code and then these words appear:    
                                                    
     # TEMPORARY, I HOPE HOPE HOPE         
                                                    
     The code beside persisting to the last—
     as permanent as aught upon this sphere—
     while overhead, a vacant moon flies past.      



## Editor’s note

Inspired by this story of the Apollo Guidance Computer code for Apollo 11,
and
this code within,
and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Ozymandias of course.

I tried to keep to Shelley’s unusual (and non-standard)
rhyme scheme for the sonnet, but I departed from it in the
second-to-last line for poetic reasons.  For a language
which excels in stealing words from other cultures, English
has an appalling lack of rhymes.
