The Spider Clan’s chief abbot had entrusted their newest
application to the monk Wangohan, allowing him to
develop it as he so desired.  At the end of the first month,
master Suku was called in to review the monk’s progress.

“You have chosen a web framework which has never been used
at the Temple,” Suku observed.  “I cannot say whether you
are employing it well or poorly, but your code twists and
wriggles around the API like a snake among the brambles.”

“I had read many encouraging reviews of this
framework,” explained the monk.  “All were promises written
upon the morning wind.  Now this snake has lost
his way.”

“Nostrils in the cold underbrush; tail still warm in
sunlight,” said Suku.

Wangohan shook his head.  “I have come too far to
turn back now.  What advice can you give for the journey
forward?”

“None at this time,” said Suku.  “But at midnight tonight,
take up a lantern and follow the path that crosses
Zjing’s Bridge.  I will send an adviser to wait for you on
the other side.”

When the appointed hour had arrived, Wangohan stole away
from the abbey and started across the long, swaying bridge
that spanned the chasm.  He had just reached its
midpoint when the planks of the far end burst into flame.
Fire shot down the ropes toward the terrified monk; half the
bridge was now ablaze.  In the terrible light, master Suku
could now be seen on the far end, extinguishing her lantern
and walking away.

Backing away from the inferno, Wangohan was enlightened.
