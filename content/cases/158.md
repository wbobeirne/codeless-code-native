On Monday a monk was sent to master Kaimu to inquire,
“What is the greatest peril of caching?”

Kaimu answered, “Monday is my busiest day.  Ask again
tomorrow and I will teach you all I know.”

On Tuesday the monk returned and asked the same question.

Kaimu answered, “Monday is my busiest day.  Ask again
tomorrow and I will teach you all I know.”

## Qi’s commentary

If the monk had asked a different question, he would have learned nothing.

## Qi’s poem

Eku asked why Mugen was rude to the shopkeeper. 
Mugen said: That shopkeeper once sold me a broken shovel. 
Eku dumped a bucket of water on Mugen’s head—
She explained: Last year my house was on fire.
