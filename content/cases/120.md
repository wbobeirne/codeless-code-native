The monk Wangohan had been given a web application to
develop on his own.  For this task he had chosen a promising
new framework, but because it was unfamiliar his initial
implementation was awkward and fragile.  For
weeks Wangohan labored to correct the problems,
restructuring his code as his understanding of the framework
grew.  By release time his application was elegant beyond
compare, and the abbots of the Spider Clan agreed to
allow the new tool in future projects.

“But first,” said the junior abbot, “we must implement the fundamental
components that the Temple will need, and provide them to all
who would consume this framework.”

To Wangohan’s great dismay, the monk Landhwa was chosen
for this task.  Worse yet, Landhwa had no interest in
studying Wangohan’s code, nor in learning from Wangohan the
many particulars of the framework.  Instead Landhwa
consulted Wangohan only when he could not be bothered to
find the answer to some simple question on his own.

Finally Wangohan asked the junior abbot of the Spider Clan why
Landhwa was chosen to lead the adoption of the framework.

“He is skilled with code, his workload was light, and he did
not object to the opportunity,” said the junior abbot
indifferently.

Wangohan bowed and went out.

The next day, master Suku summoned Wangohan to her chamber.

“The junior abbot has been taken ill with stomach cramps of
a most unpleasant nature,” she said.  “The cause is unknown,
but I suspect bad cinnamon.”

“It is a common malady,” agreed Wangohan.

“I was going to suggest as much to the junior abbot, but
learned that you had already taken him to the operating
room,” said Suku.  “I was unaware that the Temple had an
operating room.”

“It serves primarily as the carpenter’s shed,” said Wangohan.

“And I presume that the surgeon serves primarily as
the carpenter?”

“Yes,” said Wangohan. “But as I told the junior abbot:
he is skilled with blades, his
workload was light, and he did not object to the
opportunity.”
