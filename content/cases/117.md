A certain monk said to master Suku: “I have studied your
code to learn from your example, but on one question my eyes
have not yet been opened.”

The monk unfolded a source listing. “Consider this tiny
application, where you search log files for
errors.  I would have done all processing in the application
class.  Yet you define a host of additional classes: a
LogFileReader interface which has only a readEntry
method, a LogFileEntry to be returned by the method, and a
SimpleLogFileReader which is the only
implementation of the interface!  Why all this formality
for so small a project?”

Suku replied: “Go to the stables, untie my horse, and ride
him up the Drunken Serpent’s Road to the peak of this
mountain.  Then ride down and tell me what you have learned.”

The monk reappeared that evening, bruised and dirty.  “I
have learned that your horse does not like being ridden
bareback.  Also, that one may fall a long way down the
cliffside if thrown.”

Suku produced a saddle, breastplate, bridle, bit and
reins, saying: “No matter how short the journey, the rider
should be absolutely certain of where to sit and how to steer.”

The monk rubbed a huge bump on his head.  “But what will the
ill-tempered horse be certain of?”

“That he is the one being ridden,” said Suku.
